 **La**unch **sh**ell **i**nstances **fa**st

Lashifa is a tool to quickly launch lots of nicely-organized terminals. It can create tabs, columns, and rows, and pre-populate each of those terminals with a command of your choosing.

Lashifa also comes with a web-based GUI for laying out your terminals.

(Picture coming soon)


<sup>\* Lashifa may also have a less official acronym, replacing the "shi" (**sh**ell **i**nstances) with another word of your choice.</sup>
